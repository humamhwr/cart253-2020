# Class structure

## Start of class period

At __13:30__ on the day of class we will always meet in the start-of-class section of the Discord. Think of this as showing up to class on time.

- __Open the `#start-of-class-voice` channel__ so you can talk and hear what's going on (sometimes we will also turn on our webcams and screenshare as needed)
- __Keep the `#start-of-class-chat` channel open__ so you can type in questions or other material while we're meeting

During this period of class we will discuss any questions related to the week's subject matter. By the time you get to class you will have

- Watched all the __lecture videos__ and read through the __lecture notes__
- Completed or at least attempted the __weekly activity__
- __Thought of specific questions__ and emailed or Discord messaged them to the instructor (or written them down to ask during class)

## Co-working period

Once we're finished with the start of class discussion portion of the day, we will move over to co-working on the current exercises and projects as relevant for the remaining time. Attendance during this period isn't mandatory, but be aware it is one of your best opportunities to get help from the instructor and the TA both for specific problems and for larger conversations about the course material.

### General chat

While co-working you are welcome to chat to each other in the Discord via text in `#general-chat` or via voice in `#general-voice`.

### Getting help

If you need help try the following to get attention:

- Speak up in the voice channel
- Include the instructor or TA's name in a Discord message (e.g. "Hey @Pippin, can you help me?")
- Send the instructor or TA a direct message (right-click on their name/icon)

The instructor or TA can then set up a private chat/voice/video/screenshare with you to go through your questions as needed.

(Helping each other with your work is encouraged, too!)
