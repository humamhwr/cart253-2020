# Class structure


## Start of class

At 13:30 on the day of class we will always meet in the #start-of-class channel

## Tutorials

During class time we will meet in tutorial groups in order to improve the student-instructor ratio for questions and discussion. All students will be assigned to a tutorial group at the start of the course and will meet in this tutorial group with the instructor and the TA separately every week.

Your tutorial group will have its own channel on the course Discord, which is where you will meet for tutorials. You are also free to use this channel for discussions amongst yourselves as a tutorial group at other times.

### Tutorials with instructor

Tutorials with the instructor are intended to cover questions about course topics, the activities, exercises, and projects. Very specific technical problems can be discussed if there is time, but the priority will be on making sure everyone understands the ideas behind programming. It would be a good idea to write down questions and thoughts ahead of time for discussion.

### Tutorials with TA

Tutorials with the TA will focus on technical support, with students free to work quietly and ask questions of the TA as needed. It would be a good idea to write down questions over the week as you encounter them, so you are ready to discuss with the TA.

### Tutorial schedule by group

Your tutorial group will be emailed to you and will also be available on the Moodle.
