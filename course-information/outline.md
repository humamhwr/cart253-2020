## Territorial acknowledgment

We acknowledge that Concordia University is located on unceded Indigenous lands. The Kanien’kehá:ka Nation is recognized as the custodians of the lands and waters on which we gather today. Tiohtiá:ke/Montreal is historically known as a gathering place for many First Nations. Today, it is home to a diverse population of Indigenous and other peoples. We respect the continued connections with the past, present and future in our ongoing relationships with Indigenous and other peoples within the Montreal community.

## Description

Learning to program is at the heart of understanding computation. In this course we cover an introduction to the key elements of programming, all while emphasizing experimental and playful approaches to software aesthetics. Students will spend time both learning the basics of how to program while also producing their own original work in a studio environment.


## Learning Objectives

After completing this course, students should be able to:

- Read, understand and write JavaScript
- Comfortably use the arts-oriented library p5 to make digital art
- Use programming to explore and express their ideas


## Key activities

### Lecture
Each week will include a number of lecture videos and notes made by the instructor covering a specific topic in programming for students to follow in their own time.

### Activities
Each week will include a short programming activity covering the topic of the week. Students will complete the activity themselves alongside a video of the instructor doing the same work.

### Tutorials
Each week will include one hour of tutorial time with the instructor in a tutorial group on Discord during the standard class hours. This tutorials will include Q&A about the topics of the week, the activity, as well as any other points of discussion or programming examples needed.

### TA support sessions
Each week will include one hour of live technical support and Q&A on Discord with the TA in the tutorial groups.

### Exercises
Most weeks will include an evaluated programming exercise for students to demonstrate their mastery of the topic(s) covered that week.

### Projects
There will be two graded projects during the course. Each will be used as an opportunity for students to practice and develop their programming skills with room to express their own ideas.

### Office hours
The instructor will be live on Discord for further hours during the week on Discord explicitly to support students with programming topics, activities, exercises, and projects.


## Expected skills

Students are _not_ expected to have any programming experience. However, students are expected to have the desire and willingness to learn and push themselves to learn programming, and to engage deeply with thinking about creating interactive digital media through code.

## Moodle

[Moodle](https://moodle.concordia.ca/) will be used to host lecture videos as well as to submit assignments and to receive grades for them.

## GitHub

[GitHub](https://www.github.com) will replace Moodle for some course content. You are on GitHub now! The course GitHub repository will contain example code, lecture notes, course information, and more. Students will be able to post questions and issues with GitHub's issue tracker as needed.

Students will create their own repository on GitHub to save, track, and present their coursework. (Actual submission will be via Moodle, for privacy.)

## Discord

[Discord](https://discord.com/) will be used as our common space for this course. It will include general channels for everyone to hang out and chat, as well as specialized channels for tutorial groups and office hours.

## Evaluation

Specific evaluation requirements will be provided when assigned.

* Weekly exercises (10%)
   * 8 exercises worth 1.25% each
* Projects (65%)
  * Project 1 (20%)
  * Project 2 (45%)
    - Proposal (10%)
    - Project (35%)
* Participation (25%)
   * Participation includes attending tutorial sessions, being present on the Discord, asking questions, contributing to discussions, sharing ideas, and coming to office hours (even if it's just to show off your work!)

## French

Students have the right to write in French at Concordia. Pippin can read French relatively well, but cannot offer substantive feedback on writing skill itself. Given that this is a programming course, you are welcome to name variables and functions in French as well as to write comments in French.

## Policy

* Late work of any kind will lose one letter grade per day late, beginning immediately after the deadline (e.g. if it is two days late, work that would have received a B would lose two letter grades and receive a C+)
* Concordia University has an [Academic Integrity Policy](https://www.concordia.ca/students/academic-integrity.html) which must be followed.


## Costs

- See the [Department Syllabus](dcart-syllabus-2020.pdf) for Department-specific costs such as the Department fee and CDA fee
* All software students are expected to use in the class will be free.


## Technology

The practical work done in this class will take place on your own computer, with the course software installed on it. The instructor is significantly more experienced with Mac computer, but will work to support Windows and even Linux as needed. This course does not require a significantly powerful machine beyond the ability to run a web browser.
